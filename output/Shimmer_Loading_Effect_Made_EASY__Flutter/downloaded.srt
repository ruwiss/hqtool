00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
in this video you will learn how to

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
create a skimmer Shimmer how to create a

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
shimmer like this if you need something

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
like this which is a little bit more

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
complex you can click the link in the

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
description of this video personally I

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
think it's way too complex they have

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
over 300 line of code for this simple

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
example we have a total of 77 line of

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
code and I will show you how to do this

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
step by step so let's start from scratch

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
first thing first we need to create a

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
shimmer view widget this one will be a

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
stateless widget and we'll return inside

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
a column the column will have a cross

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
AIS alignment. start in order to align

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
everything on the left after this inside

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
the children we will use another widget

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
called the Shimmer box this will also

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
require a stateless widget but we will

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
need to create a Constructor we will

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
create a int flex and a double width the

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
flex will be used for the height of the

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
current Shimmer box widget we will

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
return an expanded Widget the expanded

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
will have the flex inside

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
the child will be a fractionally sized

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
box inside we can put the width factor

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
that is coming from the Constructor

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
after this inside the child of the

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
fractionally sized box you will create

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
your container the container will have a

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
padding and then a decoration the

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
decoration will have a color of black

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
opacity and a border radius of 15 the

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
next thing is to add the Shimmer box

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
inside the Shimmer view so I will add

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
multiple of them inside the children we

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
have have three Shimmer box widget and

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
three sized box widget this will create

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
one item so if we replicate this

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
multiple time this is what you will end

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
up with you can modify the code as much

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
as you want that's it see you in the

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
next one bye
