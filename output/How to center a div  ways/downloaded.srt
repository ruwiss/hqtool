00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
why is it so hard to center a div well

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
it used to be in this video we're going

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
to take a look at 12 different ways to

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
center a div

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
(Music)

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
so back in the 90s the only way to

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
center something was by using a table

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
layout please don't ever do that now

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
here's the basic setup we have a div

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
with the classic parent and then another

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
div inside that with the class of child

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and then here's the basic css styles to

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
make it look cool so for our first real

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
example we're going to make the parent

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
container position relative and the

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
child container positioned absolute

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
that's going to allow us to set the top

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
right bottom and left position of the

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
child so we'll set the top and left

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
positions to 50

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
but notice that this puts the top left

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
corner of the box in the center we can

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
account for that by using transform to

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
translate or move the x and y positions

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
of the box by negative 50 each and now

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
it's perfectly in the center for the

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
third example we'll leave the relative

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and absolute positions but this time

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
we'll set all sides top right bottom and

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
left to zero and then add margin auto

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
this is going to force our content into

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
the center or we can just consolidate

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
all of the positions the top right

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
bottom and left into one property called

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
inset and that works the exact same way

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
for our fifth example we're going to use

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
display flex on the parent container and

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
then we'll add justify content which is

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
going to center our box horizontally and

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
then align items we'll center our box

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
vertically with this method there's no

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
need to style the child container now

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
alternatively if we have multiple child

44
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
containers and we want to specify which

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
to center we can move those properties

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
to the child by using the self version

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
so here we're setting a line cell to

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
center or don't use any content or item

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
alignment at all just set margin to auto

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
on the child we can do something similar

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
with a grid layout let's set display to

52
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
grid and then justify content center and

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
align items center grid also gives us a

54
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
shorthand so we can replace the justify

55
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
content and align items with place item

56
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
center and again if we want to specify

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
which child elements get centered we can

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
move those properties to the child or

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
use the shorthand of place though or

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
just set the margin to auto on the child

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
hopefully that was helpful give this
